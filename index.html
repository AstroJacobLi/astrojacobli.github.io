<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩 (pronounced as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=zh-CN&text=李嘉轩"><strong>Lǐ Jiā Xuān</strong> </a>), a graduate student at <a class="princeton_style" href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu">Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University</a>.
<br>
<br> 
I'm interested in a variety of topics in astronomy and astrophysics, including galaxy formation and evolution, low surface brightness astrophysics, stellar population synthesis, cosmology, data science. Currently I'm working with the data from cutting-edge deep sky surveys (such as <a href="https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp">Hyper Suprime-Camera</a>) to study low surface brightness objects in our Universe. I also study how galaxies quenched with state-of-the-art cosmological simulations and <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/">IFU</a> observations.

<br>
On my homepage, you can find more than my research. I'm an amateur astronomer, music lover, driving enthusiast. I also took photos for a variety of objects, not only in the sky but also things around myself. I develop films at home. Check some of my collection here: <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/"><strong>Misc</strong></a>!

I was born and raised in <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/定西市">Dingxi</a>, Gansu Province, which is a small city in the northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear on my table.
