<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩 (pronounced as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=zh-CN&text=李嘉轩"><strong>Lǐ Jiā Xuān</strong> </a>), a graduate student at <a class="princeton_style" href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu">Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University</a>.
<br>
<br> 
I'm interested in a variety of topics in astronomy and astrophysics, such as galaxy formation and evolution, low surface brightness astrophysics, cosmology, deep sky surveys, supernova, data science and astronomical instrumentation. Currently I'm working with the data from cutting-edge deep sky surveys (such as <a href="https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp">Hyper Suprime-Camera (HSC)</a>  and <a href="http://dragonflytelescope.org">Dragonfly</a>) to study low surface brightness objects in our Universe. I also study how galaxies quench with state-of-the-art cosmological simulations and <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/">IFU</a> observations. In the future, I'm eager to develop expertise on statistical methods and machine learning.

On my homepage, you can find more than my research. I'm a big fan of music. I became an amateur astronomer since I was in sixth grade in primary school. I also took photos for a variety of objects, not only in the sky but also around myself. Check some of my collection here: <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a>!

I was born and raised in <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/定西市">Dingxi</a>, Gansu Province, which is a small city in the northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear on my table.
