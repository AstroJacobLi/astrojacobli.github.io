<p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in Department of Astronomy, <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>

<br>
<br>
My research interests focus on a variety of astrophysics and physics. My current research explore the formation and evolution of galaxies in our Universe. I'm also interested in supernova, which is one of the violentest process in the Universe.
<br>
<br>
I'm also interested in statistical physics and nonlinear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. I also studied the phase transition behaviour of droplets' shapes when Leidenfrost effect takes place on a hot surface. I'm also interested in data science. More things can be found in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io/research/"><strong>Research</strong> </a>.

<br>
In my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional tabla and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Mordern poetry, painting and photography also fascinate me. Let's enjoy <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a> together!

<br>
I was born in Dingxi, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.
