<p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in Department of Astronomy, <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>

<br>
<br> 
My research interests focus on a variety of astrophysics and physics. My current research explore the formation and evolution of galaxies in our Universe. I'm also interested in the violent process in the Universe--supernova.
<br>
<br>
Other than astrophysics, I'm interested in statistical physics and nonlinear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. I was also fascinated by the phase transition behavior of droplets' shapes when Leidenfrost effect takes place on a hot surface. More things can be found in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io/research/"><strong>Research</strong> </a>.

<br>
In my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional tabla and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. I am an amateur astronomer since I was in sixth grade. I take beautiful photos for a variety of objects in the sky. Modern poetry and painting also fascinate me. Let's enjoy <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a> together!

I was born in Dingxi, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.
