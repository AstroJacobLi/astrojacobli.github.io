<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩 (pronounced as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=zh-CN&text=李嘉轩"><strong>Lǐ Jiā Xuān</strong> </a>). I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a class="tosu" href="http://astro.pku.edu.cn ">Department of Astronomy,</a> <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>
<br>
<br> 
I'm interested in galaxy formation and evolution, sky surveys, cosmology, supernova and data science. Currently I'm working on <a href="https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp">Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC)</a> data to study the outskirts of massive galaxies and intra-cluster lights. I'm also developing image reduction algorithms to help people find faint low surface brightness structures around galaxies using <a href="http://dragonflytelescope.org">Dragonfly</a> data. I was working on <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/">MaNGA IFU</a> data before to study the H-alpha ring structures of quenching spiral galaxy. I am eager to learn deep learning methods and apply them on deetcting galaxy features.<br>
<br>
Besides, I enjoy the feeling of deriving physics formulae. I'm looking forward to chances that I can work on some theoretical problems. In the first two years of my college, I was fascinated by statistical mechanics and non-linear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach.

In my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional sidar and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. I am an amateur astronomer since I was in sixth grade. I took photos for a variety of objects in the sky. Check some of my collection here: <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a>!

I was born in <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/定西市">Dingxi</a>, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.
