On my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional tabla and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Modern poetry, painting and photography also fascinate me. Let's enjoy <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a> together! -->

I was born in Dingxi, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.

I was honored to be invited to the TV show "Voice" as a youth representative. The show is about the first image of Black Hole in the center of M87. I asked the speaker about the outreach of astronomy in China and also the future of Chinese astronomy research. Check out the video below:

I also produced a short video called <strong>"_The Unknown Secrets of the Universe_ -- Astronomy in Peking University"</strong>,  which aims at showing the journey of a astronomy student at Peking University, and also conveying the spirit of PKUer. This video is made as a gift for the 120th anniversary (May 4th, 2018) of Peking University by PKU Youth Astronomy Society. Hope you like it!

I was fascinated by the beauty of the nature since I was a child. Fortunately, my parents bought me a telescope and a camera when I was 15 years old. The former makes me a (future) astronomer, and the later brings me a lot of joy. Recently I've been trying film photography. See some of the beautiful scenes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/photography/"><strong>Photography</strong> </a>.

Let us be lovers, we’ll marry our fortunes together <br>
I’ve got some real estate here in my bag <br>
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner’s pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I’ve gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there’s one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

Cathy, I’m lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
And I’m empty and aching and I don’t know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They’ve all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America

by Paul Simon, 1968
