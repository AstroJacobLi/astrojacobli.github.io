On my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional tabla and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Modern poetry, painting and photography also fascinate me. Let's enjoy <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a> together! -->

I was born in Dingxi, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.

I was honored to be invited to the TV show "Voice" as a youth representative. The show is about the first image of Black Hole in the center of M87. I asked the speaker about the outreach of astronomy in China and also the future of Chinese astronomy research. Check out the video below:

I also produced a short video called <strong>"_The Unknown Secrets of the Universe_ -- Astronomy in Peking University"</strong>,  which aims at showing the journey of a astronomy student at Peking University, and also conveying the spirit of PKUer. This video is made as a gift for the 120th anniversary (May 4th, 2018) of Peking University by PKU Youth Astronomy Society. Hope you like it!

I was fascinated by the beauty of the nature since I was a child. Fortunately, my parents bought me a telescope and a camera when I was 15 years old. The former makes me a (future) astronomer, and the later brings me a lot of joy. Recently I've been trying film photography. See some of the beautiful scenes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/photography/"><strong>Photography</strong> </a>.

Let us be lovers, we’ll marry our fortunes together <br>
I’ve got some real estate here in my bag <br>
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner’s pies<br>
And we walked off to look for America<br>
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh<br>
Michigan seems like a dream to me now<br>
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw<br>
I’ve gone to look for America<br>
<br>
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces<br>
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy<br>
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera<br>
Toss me a cigarette, I think there’s one in my raincoat<br>
We smoked the last one an hour ago<br>
So I looked at the scenery<br>
She read her magazine<br>
And the moon rose over an open field<br>
<br>
Cathy, I’m lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping<br>
And I’m empty and aching and I don’t know why<br>
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike<br>
They’ve all come to look for America<br>
All come to look for America<br>
All come to look for America<br>
<br>
by Paul Simon, 1968
