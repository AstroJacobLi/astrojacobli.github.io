## Hedgehog galaxy: an isolated quiescent galaxy at 2.4 Mpc
Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00101) on arXiv!

The interactive 3-D figure below shows the environment that Hedgehog lives in. Hedgehog is a quiescent galaxy at 2.4 Mpc, which is very isolated from other galaxies. It takes ~20s to load. You can zoom in/out and rotate the figure to explore the environment of Hedgehog.
