  title: "A Possible 'Too-Many-Satellites' Problem in the Isolated Dwarf Galaxy DDO 161"
  description: "We report the satellite system of an isolated dwarf galaxy DDO 161. Having 4 confirmed satellites, it is the most satellite-rich dwarf galaxy known to date, with a likelihood of 0.04% under the TNG50 cosmological simulation. It challenges the current understanding of how low-mass galaxies populate dark matter halos in low-density environments."
