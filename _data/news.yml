  title: "A Possible 'Too-Many-Satellites' Problem in the Isolated Dwarf Galaxy DDO 161"
  description: "We report the most satellite-rich dwarf galaxy known to date, DDO 161, with a likelihood of 0.04% finding such a system in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. It challenges the current understanding of how low-mass galaxies populate dark matter halos in low-density environments."
