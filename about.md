<p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in Department of Astronomy, <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in galaxy formation and evolution, cosmology, supernovae and data science. Other than working on MaNGA IFU data to study the H-alpha ring structures of quenching spiral galaxy, I'm also working on Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) data to study the outskirts of massive galaxies.
<br>
<br>
I'm also interested in statistical physics and nonlinear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. I also studied the phase transition behaviour of droplets' shapes when Leidenfrost effect takes place on a hot surface. I'm also interested in data science. More things can be found on <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io/research/"><strong>Research</strong> </a>.
