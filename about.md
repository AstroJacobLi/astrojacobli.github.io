<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩, which is probably pronounced as Chia-Shuien Lee. I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in Department of Astronomy, <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in galaxy formation and evolution, cosmology, supernova and data science. Other than working on MaNGA IFU data to study the H-alpha ring structures of quenching spiral galaxy, I'm also working on Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) data to study the outskirts of massive galaxies.

Besides, I enjoy the feeling of deriving physics formulae. I especially like statistical physics and nonlinear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. I was also fascinated by the phase transition behavior of droplets' shapes when Leidenfrost effect takes place on a hot surface.
