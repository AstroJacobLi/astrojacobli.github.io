<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩 (pronounced as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=zh-CN&text=李嘉轩"><strong>Lǐ Jiā Xuān</strong> </a>). I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a class="tosu" href="http://astro.pku.edu.cn ">Department of Astronomy,</a> <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>

I'm interested in galaxy formation and evolution, sky surveys, cosmology, supernova and data science. Currently I'm working on <a href="https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp">Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC)</a> data to study the outskirts of massive galaxies and intra-cluster lights. I'm also developing image reduction algorithms to help people find faint low surface brightness structures around galaxies using <a href="http://dragonflytelescope.org">Dragonfly</a> data. I was working on <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/">MaNGA IFU</a> data before to study the H-alpha ring structures of quenching spiral galaxy. I am eager to learn deep learning methods and apply them on deetcting galaxy features.

Besides, I enjoy the feeling of deriving physics formulae. I'm looking forward to chances that I can work on some theoretical problems. In the first two years of my college, I was fascinated by statistical mechanics and non-linear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. More things can be found on <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io/research/"><strong>Research</strong> </a>.
