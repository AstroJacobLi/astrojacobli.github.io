I'm a third-year undergraduate student in Department of Astronomy, Peking University. I'm interested in galaxy formation and evolution, cosmology, supernovae and data science. Other than working on MaNGA IFU data to study the H-alpha ring structures of quenching spiral galaxy, I'm also working on Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) data to study the outskirts of massive galaxies.

I'm also interested in statistical physics and nonlinear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. I also studied the phase transition behaviour of droplets' shapes when Leidenfrost effect takes place on a hot surface. I'm also interested in data science.
