<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. Learn and explore all phases and surveys—past, present, and future—of the SDSS.</p>

<p>It’s just 20 years old. See <a href="https://www.sdss.org/press-releases/sdss20/">

<h2 id="des">DES</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">Dark Energy Survey</a> (DES) is a visible and near-infrared survey that aims to probe the dynamics of the expansion of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure. The survey uses the 4-meter Victor M. Blanco Telescope located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. It uses g, r, i, z, and Y bands. DECam has one of the widest fields of view (2.2-degree diameter) available for ground-based optical and infrared imaging.</p>

<p>It can do: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02376v1">supernovae cosmology</a>, BAO, galaxy cluster finder, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01530">weak lensing</a>, etc.</p>

<p>I uses <a href="http://legacysurvey.org/decamls/">DECaLS</a> (DECam Legacy Survey). Dustin Lang made a wonderful <a href="http://legacysurvey.org/viewer#IC%20968">skyview map</a>. Currently DES is only a photometric survey.</p>

<h2 id="hsc">HSC</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/">Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program</a> (HSC-SSP) is led by the astronomical communities of Japan and Taiwan, and Princeton University. It’s a photometric survey for 1400 square degrees using Hyper Suprime-Cam mounted on 8.2m <a href="https://subarutelescope.org">Subaru Telescope</a>. It is now the seriously kicking-ass survey for galaxies and cosmology.</p>

<p>The main science goals contain: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09148v1">weak lensing cosmology</a>, high-z galaxies, general galaxy formation and evolution (like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01139v1">stellar-halo connection</a>), etc.</p>
