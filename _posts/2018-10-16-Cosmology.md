# Cosmology Textbooks

- [Introduction to Cosmology](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Cosmology-Barbara-Ryden/dp/1107154839/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1539634625&sr=8-3&keywords=introduction+to+cosmology) by Barbara Ryden: Good introduction book, containing basic topics. But this book lacks some detailed calculations.

- [Galaxy Formation and Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Formation-Evolution-Houjun-Mo/dp/0521857937/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539634728&sr=8-1&keywords=galaxy+formation) by Houjun Mo, Frank van den Bosch and Simon White: Bible of Cosmology and Galaxy Evolution. It contains everything you want.

- [Principles of Physical Cosmology](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Physical-Cosmology-Phillip-Peebles/dp/0691074283/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539634841&sr=8-1&keywords=physical+cosmology) by Peebles: This is more like a reference book, and may be out-of-date. 

- [Cosmological Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Cosmological-Physics-Cambridge-Astrophysics-Peacock-ebook/dp/B00INYGDII/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1539634953&sr=8-2&keywords=cosmology+peacock) by Peacock: Very complicated and hard to understand, but Yingjie said it's worth reading. 

- [Observational Cosmology](https://www.amazon.com/Observational-Cosmology-Stephen-Serjeant/dp/0521157153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539635005&sr=8-1&keywords=observational+cosmology) by Stephen Serjeant: A very very good textbook on observational cosmology! Definitely worth reading! 

- [Cosmology](https://www.amazon.com/Cosmology-Steven-Weinberg/dp/0198526822/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539635176&sr=8-1&keywords=cosmology+weinberg) by Weinberg: Theoretical physicist's approach.

- [Lecture notes on cosmology](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319955698) by Oliver Piattella: A good lecture notes for graduate cosmology. I like the miscellaneous part of this book which talks about supernova cosmology. This lecture notes can also be downloaded from [here](http://ofp.cosmo-ufes.org/uploads/1/3/7/0/13701821/cosmology-ln.pdf).
