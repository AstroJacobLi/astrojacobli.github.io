# ARAA notes
Feel very ashamed for the decadence in the past year 2018. I will try to read as many paper as possible and do my best in 2019.

## [Weak Lensing for Precision Cosmology, by Rachel Mandelbaum](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-astro-081817-051928)
#### Moments of images
The moment of a 2-D distribution about the point $$(c_x, c_y)$$ is defined as a kind of average (this definition is straightforward):
$$M_{m, n} = \frac{\int \rho(x, y) (x-c_x)^m (y-c_y)^n \md x\md y}{\int \rho(x, y)\md x\md y}.$$
For images, the moment can be generalized as
$$M_{m, n} = \frac{\int I(x, y)W(x, y)( x-c_x)^m (y-c_y)^n \md x\md y}{\int I(x, y)W(x, y)\md x\md y},$$
where $$I(x, y)$$ is the intensity map and $$W(x, y)$$ is a weighting function.




## [The Connection Between Galaxies and Their Dark Matter Halos, by Risa Wechsler and Jeremy Tinker](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-astro-081817-051756)
